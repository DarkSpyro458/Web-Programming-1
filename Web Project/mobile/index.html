               <h3>Why Should I Care About My Privacy, I have Nothing to hide?</h3>
               <p>Many people say that privacy on the Internet is not necessary, referencing a statement from the nothing to hide argument: “You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide”. However, arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. People who believe strongly in the nothing to hide argument do not understand the basic foundation of human rights, because nobody needs to justify why they need a right, the burden of justification falls on the one seeking infringement upon the right. </p>
			   <h3>Examples of How our Privacy is being Violated</h3>
			   <p>One example of violation of our online privacy is The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, also known as the CLOUD act, which is a bill that enables the United States government or any other government that the United States has surveillance partnerships with to obtain private user data without any search warrants or probable causes, essentially creating a back-door on the 4th amendment. The CLOUD act is significant because it strips away American companies of any protection from unwarranted data requests, and under the CLOUD act the government does not need to go to court, instead the CLOUD act allows the United States to go directly to the US company and the company is legally entitled to hand over any data that is requested. This is unethical, because the CLOUD act allows the United States Government to breach private data, which directly violates the 3rd commandment of computer ethics, which states “Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.” </p>
			   <p>Another example of unethical violation of online privacy is Facebook, who’s privacy policy is intentionally vague, and doesn't provide any reasonable boundaries on what Facebook can track about you. Facebook attempts to store permanent trackers using cookies, cookies are known as “a short line of text that a web site puts on your computer's hard drive when you access the web site.” According to Facebook's own privacy policy states “Facebook authorizes itself to (1) track its users across websites and devices; (2) use profile pictures for both commercial and non-commercial purposes and (3) collect information about its users’ whereabouts on a continuous basis.” More evidence of Facebook’s tracking can be found in a report named “Facebook Tracking Through Social Plug-ins” which states “With a clean virtual machine, we visited Facebook’s homepage (facebook.com) We found that, a cookie named “datr” with a 2-year lifetime was set. The “datr” cookie contained 24-character random-looking alphanumeric string and was scoped to the domain facebook.com and the path “/” meaning the cookie will be sent when fetching resources from the domain facebook.com and all its subdomains.” This evidence of Facebook's intrusive tracking shows the level that they will go to try and track you for commercial purposes, and is unethical because it is an attempt and creating a digital profile of people also known as a digital fingerprint, which is defined as “the identification of large data files or structures using truncated information. A fingerprinting algorithm is one that reduces a larger data set to a very small data set, sometimes called a bit string, to promote efficient identification and search protocols.” These fingerprints are than used to sell to other companies for profit, and all of the tracking and data collection that Facebook does is in direct violation of 2 of the Ten Commandments of Computer ethics, numbers 3 and 10. “Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.” and “Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for other humans”. The reason that number 10 Is violated is because making an attempt to forge someone’s identity digitally through the means of tracking is not showing any consideration or respect for the human that is being tracked. </p>
