            <p>
               Many people say that privacy on the Internet is not necessary, referencing a statement from the nothing to hide<br>
               argument: “You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide”. However, arguing that you don’t care about 
               the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech 
               because you have nothing to say. People who believe strongly in the nothing to hide argument do not understand 
               the basic foundation of human rights, because nobody needs to justify why they need a right, the burden of 
               justification falls on the one seeking infringement upon the right.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Examples of How our Privacy is being Violated</h2>
            <!-- P1 CLOUD ACT -->
            <p>
               One example of violation of our online privacy is The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, also known as the<br>CLOUD act,
			   which is a bill that enables the United States government or any other government that the United States has surveillance
			   partnerships with to obtain private user data without any search warrants or probable causes, essentially creating a back-door
			   on the 4th amendment. The CLOUD act is significant because it strips away American companies of any protection from 
			   unwarranted data requests, and under the CLOUD act the government does not need to go to court, instead the CLOUD act allows
			   the United States to go directly to the US company and the company is legally entitled to hand over any data that is requested.
			   This is unethical, because the CLOUD act allows the United States Government to breach private data, which directly violates
			   the 3rd commandment of computer ethics, which states “Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.”
            </p>
            <!-- P2 Facebook's Privacy Practices -->
            <p>
               Another example of unethical violation of online privacy is Facebook, who’s privacy policy is intentionally vague, 
			   and doesn't provide any reasonable boundaries on what Facebook can track about you. Facebook attempts to store permanent 
			   trackers using cookies, cookies are known as “a short line of text that a web site puts on your computer's hard drive when 
			   you access the web site.” According to Facebook's own privacy policy states “Facebook authorizes itself to (1) track its users
			   across websites and devices; (2) use profile pictures for both commercial and non-commercial purposes and (3) collect 
			   information about its users’ whereabouts on a continuous basis.” More evidence of Facebook’s tracking can be found in a 
			   report named “Facebook Tracking Through Social Plug-ins” which states “With a clean virtual machine, we visited Facebook’s 
			   homepage (facebook.com) We found that, a cookie named “datr” with a 2-year lifetime was set. The “datr” cookie contained 
			   24-character random-looking alphanumeric string and was scoped to the domain facebook.com and the path “/” meaning the cookie
			   will be sent when fetching resources from the domain facebook.com and all its subdomains.” This evidence of Facebook's
			   intrusive tracking shows the level that they will go to try and track you for commercial purposes, and is unethical because
			   it is an attempt and creating a digital profile of people also known as a digital fingerprint, which is defined as
			   “the identification of large data files or structures using truncated information. A fingerprinting algorithm is one that
			   reduces a larger data set to a very small data set, sometimes called a bit string, to promote efficient identification and 
			   search protocols.” These fingerprints are than used to sell to other companies for profit, and all of the tracking and data 
			   collection that Facebook does is in direct violation of 2 of the Ten Commandments of Computer ethics, numbers 3 and 10. 
			   “Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.” and “Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure 
			   consideration and respect for other humans”. The reason that number 10 Is violated is because making an attempt to forge 
			   someone’s identity digitally through the means of tracking is not showing any consideration or respect for the human that
			   is being tracked.
